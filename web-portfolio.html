            I wanted my portfolio to be simple and clear, with an attractive layout on all devices and easy-to-follow sections that cohere with the whole of the page. Accordingly, I set out to build this site exclusively using HTML, CSS/SCSS, and a little JavaScript. In all, building this site took me about a week, from design to deployment. <br><br>
    
            I used Javascript to toggle my dropdown menu on mobile devices, and to prevent repeating HTML code for header and topnav on every page. Using SCSS allowed me to take advantage of nesting and variables to create a cleaner stylesheet. <br><br>
