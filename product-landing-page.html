            This is the landing page for the Automated Scribal Identification Project. Based at Stanford, this project is a multi-university collaboration applying handwriting identification software to analyzing ancient manuscripts.<br><br>
    
            I worked for the project head to design and develop this entire website. Because I wanted to learn more about CSS, I built the site entirely from scratch, writing all of the code myself. I learned lots about media queries, mobile-first web design, and catering projects to client specifications.<br><br>
